# backbase

This project serves as a lightweight framework were the Flipbase recorder and
the Flipbase player can be build upon. It contains a global store, a model 
and a component class. 

## To do

[ ] How to determine which options properties should be attached to the 
    Component instance?!
[ ] Not every elements needs to have JS logic or events attached to it; so we 
    need to somehow implement a workaround for this.
